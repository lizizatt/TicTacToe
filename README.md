A Tic-Tac-Toe implementation, rendered in OpenGL using a single cube VBO and texture, used as a stamp to render a number of cubes distributed in a scene graph.  Cubes have an optional callback to respond if clicked, enabling user interface and flow logic.  

Developed using VS2017 on Windows 10, cmake, glfw, glad, glm over the course of a week while I was moving house.  Cause nothing should be easy, right?
